## PDF Merger Java API

[com.groupdocs.merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/java) allows developers to combine multiple image documents in the preferred order and save them as a single PDF file.

## About PDF File Format

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins.

### How to merge image files to PDF

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files to PDF file with several lines of Java code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/merger/) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. Additionally, pass instance of [LoadOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger.domain.options/loadoptions/) class as a second constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/merger/#join-java.io.InputStream-) method. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/merger/) class [save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/merger/#save-java.io.OutputStream-) method and specify the filename for the merged PDF file as parameter.

```java

// Load the source image file
Merger merger = new Merger("c:\sample1.jpeg", new LoadOptions(FileType.PDF))
{
    // Add another image file to merge
    merger.join("c:\sample2.png");
    // Add next image file to merge
    merger.join("c:\sample3.bmp");
    // Merge image files and save PDF result
    merger.save("c:\merged.pdf");
}
```

### Result merged PDF file
