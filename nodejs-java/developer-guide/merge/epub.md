## How to merge EPUB files in Node.js via Java

You can easily combine multiple EPUB files into one using [GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/nodejs-java) library API and all the files content will be preserved.
The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge EPUB files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/Merger) class and pass source EPUB file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another EPUB file to merge with [join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/Merger#join(java.io.InputStream)) method. Repeat this step for other EPUB documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/Merger) class [save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/Merger#save(java.io.OutputStream)) method and specify the filename for the merged EPUB file as parameter.

```java
const inputFilePath = `c:/sample1.epub`;
const merger = new groupdocs.merger.Merger(inputFilePath)
const outputPath = `c:/merged.epub`;
merger.join('c:/sample2.epub');
merger.save(outputPath);
```

### About EPUB File Format 

Files with .EPUB extension are an e-book file format that provide a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides the support for opening such files. In addition, there are a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers.
