## ZIP Merger Python via .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/python-net) allows developers to combine multiple archive documents in the preferred order and save them as a single ZIP file.

## About ZIP File Format

A file with .zip extension is an archive that can hold one or more files or directories. The archive can have compression applied to the included files in order to reduce the ZIP file size. ZIP file format was made public back in February 1989 by Phil Katz for achieving archiving of files and folders. The format was made part of PKZIP utility, created by PKWARE, Inc. Right after the availability of available specifications, many companies made ZIP file format part of their software utilities including Microsoft (since Windows 7), Apple (Mac OS X ) and many others.


### How to merge archives to ZIP file

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge archives to ZIP file with several lines of Python via .NET code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/) class and pass source archive file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another archive file to merge with [join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join/#join) method. Repeat this step for other archive documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/) class [save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged archive file as parameter.

```python
with gm.Merger("c:/sample1.zip") as merger:
    merger.join("c:/sample2.tar")
    merger.join("c:/sample3.rar")
    merger.save("c:/merged.zip")
```
