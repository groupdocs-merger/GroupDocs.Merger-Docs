## How to merge EPUB files in Python via .NET

You can easily combine multiple EPUB files into one using [GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/python-net) library API and all the files content will be preserved.
The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge EPUB files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/Merger) class and pass source EPUB file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another EPUB file to merge with [join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join/#join) method. Repeat this step for other EPUB documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/Merger) class [save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged EPUB file as parameter.

```python
with gm.Merger("c:/sample1.epub") as merger:
    merger.join("c:/sample2.epub")
    merger.save("c:/merged.epub")
```

### About EPUB File Format 

Files with .EPUB extension are an e-book file format that provide a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides the support for opening such files. In addition, there are a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers.
