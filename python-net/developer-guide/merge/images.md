## How to merge image files in Python via .NET

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/python-net) allows developers to combine multiple JPG documents in the preferred order and save them as a single file. You will not spend your time doing these operations manually on desktop software.
 With GroupDocs.Merger it is possible to combine image documents of any JPG, PNG or BMP extensions.

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files with several lines of Python via .NET code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/Merger) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Create an instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/ImageJoinOptions) class and pass enum value of [ImageJoinMode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/ImageJoinMode) as a constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join/#join) method and pass instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/ImageJoinOptions) class as a method parameter. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/Merger) class [save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged image file as parameter.

```python
with gm.Merger("c:/sample1.jpg") as merger:
    image_join_mode = gm.domain.options.ImageJoinMode.HORIZONTAL
    image_join_options = gm.domain.options.ImageJoinOptions(image_join_mode)
    merger.join("c:/sample2.jpg", join_options = image_join_options)
    merger.save("c:/merged.jpg")
```
