## BMP Merger .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple BMP documents in the preferred order and save them as a single file.

## About BMP File Format

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome and colored formats with various color depths.

### Download and Configure

Use the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger/net) to download API DLLs or MSI installer or NuGet:
```csharp
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

### Source BMP images

### How to merge BMP files in vertical mode

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files in vertical mode with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Create an instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class and pass enum value of [ImageJoinMode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinmode) as a constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [Join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join) method and pass instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class as a method parameter. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged image file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source image file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.bmp"))
{
    // Define image join options with vertical join mode
    ImageJoinOptions joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Vertical);
    // Add another image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.bmp", joinOptions);
    // Add next image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample3.bmp", joinOptions);
    // Merge image files and save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.bmp");
}
```

### Result merged BMP image

!["Merged.bmp"](/merger/net/images/jpg/merged_vertical.jpg)
