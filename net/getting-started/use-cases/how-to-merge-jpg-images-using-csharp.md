## JPG Merger .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple JPG documents in the preferred order and save them as a single file.

## About JPG File Format

JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

### Download and Configure

Use the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger/net) to download API DLLs or MSI installer or NuGet:
```csharp
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

### Source JPG images

!["Sample2.jpg"](/merger/net/images/jpg/sample2.jpg)
!["Sample3.jpg"](/merger/net/images/jpg/sample3.jpg)

### How to merge JPG files as photo collage

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files as photo collage with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Create an instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class and pass enum value of [ImageJoinMode](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinmode) as a constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [Join](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/join/index) method and pass instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class as a method parameter. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method and specify the filename for the merged image file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source image file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.jpg"))
{
    // Define image join options with horizontal join mode
    ImageJoinOptions joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Horizontal);
    // Add another image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.jpg", joinOptions);
    // Define image join options with vertical join mode
    joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Vertical);
    // Add next image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample3.jpg", joinOptions);
    // Merge image files and save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.jpg");
}
```

### Result merged JPG image

!["Merged.jpg"](/merger/net/images/jpg/merged_grid.jpg)
