## MP3 Merger .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple MP3 audio files in the preferred order and save them as a single file.

## About MP3 File Format

The MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) file format is a widely used audio compression format known for its ability to significantly reduce the file size of audio recordings while maintaining reasonably good sound quality. MP3 is a lossy audio compression format, which means that it achieves smaller file sizes by removing some of the audio data that is less perceptible to the human ear. 

MP3 is one of the most universally supported audio formats. It is compatible with a wide range of devices, software, and platforms, making it suitable for sharing and playback across different systems.

### Download and Configure

Use the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger/net) to obtain the API DLLs, MSI installer, or NuGet package:
```shell
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

### How to merge several MP3 files into a single file

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge multiple audio files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of the [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass the source audio file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file paths as per your requirements.
* Add another audio file to merge with the [Join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join) method. Repeat this step for other audio files you want to merge.
* Call the [Save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the resulting audio file as a parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source MP3 file
using (var merger = new GroupDocs.Merger.Merger(@"c:\sample1.mp3"))
{
    // Add another MP3 file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.mp3");
    // Add next audio file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample3.mp3");
    // Merge MP3 files and save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.mp3");
}
```
