## PNG Merger .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple PNG documents in the preferred order and save them as a single file.

## About PNG File Format

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format.

### How to merge PNG files in horizontal mode

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files in horizontal mode with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Create an instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class and pass enum value of [ImageJoinMode](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinmode) as a constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [Join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join) method and pass instance of [ImageJoinOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/imagejoinoptions) class as a method parameter. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged image file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source image file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.png"))
{
    // Define image join options with horizontal join mode
    ImageJoinOptions joinOptions = new ImageJoinOptions(ImageJoinMode.Horizontal);
    // Add another image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.png", joinOptions);
    // Add next image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample3.png", joinOptions);
    // Merge image files and save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.png");
}
```

### Result merged PNG image

!["Merged.png"](/merger/net/images/jpg/merged_horizontal.jpg)
