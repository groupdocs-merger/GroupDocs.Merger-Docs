## PDF Merger .NET API

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple image documents in the preferred order and save them as a single PDF file.

## About PDF File Format

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in the 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins.

### How to merge image files to PDF

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge image files to PDF file with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source image file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. Additionally, pass instance of [LoadOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/loadoptions) class as a second constructor parameter.
* Add another image file to merge with [Join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join) method. Repeat this step for other image documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged PDF file as parameter.

```csharp

// Load the source image file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.jpeg", new LoadOptions(FileType.PDF)))
{
    // Add another image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.png");
    // Add next image file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample3.bmp");
    // Merge image files and save PDF result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.pdf");
}
```

### Result merged PDF file
