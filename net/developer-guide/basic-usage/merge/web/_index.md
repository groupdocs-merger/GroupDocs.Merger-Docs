A complete website can be built consisting of static as well as dynamic webpages. Most modern websites are built on server side technology such as Active Server Pages (ASP) that are loaded and run on the web server. These also include cascading styling sheets (CSS) and scripting files used for the styling the overall look and feel of UI.
