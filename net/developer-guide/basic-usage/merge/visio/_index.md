## About Microsoft Visio File Formats

From 2013 Microsoft Visio has introduced a new file format **VSDX** which is the replacement of two other file formats known as **VSD** (Visio binary file format) and **VDX** (Visio XML Drawing file format). .vsdx has increased the interoperability of the Visio files because now third-party software can also manipulate Visio files at a file format level. The new file format is supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server, and does not need any “intermediary” file format for publishing to SharePoint Server.
