## How to merge XLTM files in C#

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to merge XLTM files when it's needed to organize multiple
 XLTM files into single document or send fewer attachments etc. And you can do this without any third-party software or manual work involved.
 With GroupDocs.Merger it is possible to combine XLTM documents of any size and structure - all text, images, tables, graphs, forms and other content will be preserved.

The following example demonstrates how to merge XLTM files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source XLTM file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another XLTM file to merge with [Join](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/join/index) method. Repeat this step for other XLTM documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method and specify the filename for the merged XLTM file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source XLTM file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.xltm"))
{
    // Add another XLTM file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.xltm");
    // Merge XLTM files ans save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.xltm");
}
```

### About XLTM File Format 

The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later doesn't support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.
