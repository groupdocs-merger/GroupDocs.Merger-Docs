## How to merge DOC files in C#

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to merge DOC files when it's needed to organize multiple
 DOC files into single document or send fewer attachments etc. And you can do this without any third-party software or manual work involved.
 With GroupDocs.Merger it is possible to combine DOC documents of any size and structure - all text, images, tables, graphs, forms and other content will be preserved.

The following example demonstrates how to merge DOC files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source DOC file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another DOC file to merge with [Join](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/join/index) method. Repeat this step for other DOC documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method and specify the filename for the merged DOC file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source DOC file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.doc"))
{
    // Add another DOC file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.doc");
    // Merge DOC files ans save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.doc");
}
```
