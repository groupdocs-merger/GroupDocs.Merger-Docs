## How to merge OTT files in C#

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to merge OTT files when it's needed to organize multiple
 OTT files into single document or send fewer attachments etc. And you can do this without any third-party software or manual work involved.
 With GroupDocs.Merger it is possible to combine OTT documents of any size and structure - all text, images, tables, graphs, forms and other content will be preserved.

The following example demonstrates how to merge OTT files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source OTT file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another OTT file to merge with [Join](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/join/index) method. Repeat this step for other OTT documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method and specify the filename for the merged OTT file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source OTT file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.ott"))
{
    // Add another OTT file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.ott");
    // Merge OTT files ans save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.ott");
}
```

### About OTT File Format 

Files with OTT extension represent template documents generated by applications in compliance with the OASIS' OpenDocument standard format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold settings that can be used to generate new documents from these template files. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.
