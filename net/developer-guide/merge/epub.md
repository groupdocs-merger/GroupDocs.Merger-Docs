## How to merge EPUB files in CSharp

You can easily combine multiple EPUB files into one using [GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) library API and all the files content will be preserved.
The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge EPUB files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source EPUB file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another EPUB file to merge with [Join](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/join/index) method. Repeat this step for other EPUB documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/merger/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method and specify the filename for the merged EPUB file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source EPUB file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.epub"))
{
    // Add another EPUB file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.epub");
    // Merge EPUB files ans save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.epub");
}
```

### About EPUB File Format 

Files with .EPUB extension are an e-book file format that provide a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides the support for opening such files. In addition, there are a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers.
