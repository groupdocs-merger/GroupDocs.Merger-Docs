## How to merge archive files in C\#

[GroupDocs.Merger](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net) allows developers to combine multiple ZIP documents in the preferred order and save them as a single file. You will not spend your time doing these operations manually on desktop software.
 With GroupDocs.Merger it is possible to combine archive documents of any archive extensions such as ZIP or TAR.

The following example demonstrates how toÂ merge archive files with several lines of C# code:

* Create an instance of [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class and pass source archive file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements.
* Add another archive file to merge with [Join](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/join) method. Repeat this step for other archive documents you want to merge.
* Call [Merger](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class [Save](https://reference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/save) method and specify the filename for the merged archive file as parameter.

```csharp
// Load the source archive file
using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample1.zip"))
{
    // Add another archive file to merge
    merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.zip");
    // Merge archive files and save result
    merger.Save(@"c:\merged.zip");
}
```
